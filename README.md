# Triton2024ML

We followed documentation on YOLO's website to create a model using custom data, but moved to Google Colab for better processing power. Due to time constraints we used YOLO's python notebook tutorial for the proper environment for training our custom data. We did not exactly follow the python notebook but instead uploaded a revised version of it to this repo. It is quite messy and untidy due to time constraints.

Our data set is quite large so time is needed to upload it properly.
